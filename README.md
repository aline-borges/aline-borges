##### 

My name is Aline Borges, I'm currently an intern in web development and I'm studying technologies such as React, Jest and Sass.


I'm passionate about Front-End development and the more I learn, the more I like it.

 # My History

  I started in the I.T. area in July 2017, starting a Programming course at Microlins, where I got in touch with the Visual Basic and C# programming language and SQL Server database.
  
  In August 2017, I started my studies at UniCarioca college, studying System Analysis and Development. In the following year, I did a course exchange for Computer Science and I am currently in the 7th period.
  
  I've been taking courses on HTML, CSS, React, Jest and looking for free knowledge on UI and UX Design, where I seek to create projects to practice learning.

  I really like the layout part of an application, so I created a Behance account to post my layouts and learn from the layouts of other users I see there.
