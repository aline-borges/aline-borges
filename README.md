## I started in the I.T. area in July 2017, starting a Programming course at Microlins, where I got in touch with the Visual Basic and C# programming language and SQL Server database. 

## In August 2017, I started my studies at UniCarioca college, studying System Analysis and Development. In the following year, I did a course exchange for Computer Science and I am currently in the 7th period. 

## My area of interest since the beginning was the Front-End part and this will only intensified during those years. 

## I've been taking courses on HTML, CSS, React, Jest and looking for free knowledge on UI and UX Design, where I seek to create projects to practice learning.
